Transformers:
The Transformer architecture is a deep learning model built on self-attention rather than recurrence or convolution, allowing it to process all tokens in a sequence in parallel while dynamically learning which parts of the input are most relevant. It consists of encoder–decoder blocks that use multi-head self-attention, feed-forward networks, skip connections, and positional encodings to understand context without relying on sequential processing like RNNs. This parallelism makes Transformers far more scalable, enabling training on massive datasets and GPU acceleration. Unlike RNNs/LSTMs, Transformers can capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships efficiently, making them ideal for language modeling, translation, summarization, and document understanding. Their flexibility and modularity also allow adaptation to multimodal inputs (text, vision, speech), which has led to architectures like BERT, GPT, T5, and Vision Transformers. Combined with large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning, Transformers have become the foundation of modern NLP systems due to their superior performance, speed, scalability, and ability to generalize across domains.
